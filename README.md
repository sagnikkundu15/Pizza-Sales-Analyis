# Pizza Sales Analytics Project 

## Overview  
This project uses SQL queries to analyse pizza-order data, inspired by a tutorial. It answers key business questions about orders, revenue, product performance and time-based patterns.

## Motivation & Scope  
- The goal: derive actionable insights from pizza sales data â€” for example: which pizzas sell most, when, and how revenue evolves over time.  
- The dataset mimics typical pizza-shop tables: `orders`, `order_details`, `pizzas`.  
- The queries address the following business questions:  
  1. Total number of orders placed  
  2. Total revenue generated from pizza sales  
  3. Highest-priced pizza  
  4. Most common pizza size ordered  
  5. Top 5 most ordered pizza types (with quantities)  
  6. Distribution of orders by hour of day  
  7. Top 3 pizza types by revenue  
  8. Cumulative revenue generated over time
